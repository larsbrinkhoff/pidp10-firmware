# ICL 1900 simulator.

This is a new simulator. Will pass 1904E/1905E CPU diagnostics (FLIT). Will boot paper
tape executive E4BM and tape executive E6RM. Still need to add more devices and test
with George 2 and 3.

  The CPU can be configured for model A, B or C type system. Or models 1901 throgh 1909. 
Paging is currently not supported. Both standard interface and older non-standard interface
are supported on most device.


# IBM 360 simulator.

Currently will run BOS/360, TOS/360, DOS/360, OS/360. IBM 360/67 support added for MTS early
versions.  IBM 370 support will currently run VM/370, TSS, OS/VS1.

# SEL32 Concept/32 Simulator

This is a working simulator for the SEL Concept/32 line of computers.  The
current version is for the SEL 32/27, 32/67, 32/87, 32/97, V6, and V9
computers.  Support for 32/55, and 32/75 computers may be added in the future.
This simulator is co-authors with James C. Bevier. I did the initial parts
of the simulator, James took it to a working simulator, I am assisting him
in maintaining and enhancing the simulator. 

All of the processors except for the 32/77 can run the Gould diags.  MPX 1.X
support for the 32/77 computers may be added in the future.  The level one
diags are run as part of the SIMH build of SEL32 to verify that the simulator
is operating correctly.  The diags are located in the tests directory.  Diag.tap
contains the diagnostic programs and diag.ini contains the directives to
configure and run the SEL32 simulator.

This simulator is capable of running UTX2.1A, UTX2.1B, MPX 1.5F, MPX 3.4,
MPX 3.5 and MPX 3.6.  It is capable of creating a disk image for the
O/S from a UTX or MPX SDT tape. The disk image can be booted, initialized,
and can run many of the UTX and MPX utilities and programs. Ethernet is
supported on UTX and will be added to MPX in the future.  Eight terminals
can be used to access MPX via Telnet port 4747. The sumulator has support
for excess 64 floating point arithmetic and passes the 32/27 and 32/67 FP
diags.  UTX is the SEL version of System V Unix and BSD Unix ported to the
V6 and V9 processors.  UTX utilizes the basemode instruction set and a
virtual memory system supported by the V6 & V9 CPUs.  The system needs
further testing to solidify the SEL32 simulator code in all of the
supported environmenets.
